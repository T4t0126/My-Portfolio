🎨 Design Principles

Typography-led layouts

One accent color used intentionally

No generic “startup” aesthetics

Motion used only when it improves clarity

3D treated as atmospheric infrastructure

Dark mode is default; light mode is editorial

If any section feels generic, it’s redesigned.

♿ Accessibility & Performance

WCAG AA color contrast

Keyboard-navigable UI

prefers-reduced-motion respected

Lazy-loaded Three.js canvas

Lighthouse scores ≥ 90 across metrics
